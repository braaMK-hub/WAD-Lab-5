# WAD621S Lab 5 Submission - Design Decisions

## Design Choices
- Used CSS variables for consistent theming throughout the application
- Implemented a clean, minimal design approach with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Chose a blue color scheme (#4361ee primary) for modern, professional appearance
- Used Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts

## Challenges Faced
- Getting the customization panel to slide in/out smoothly
- Making all components responsive across different screen sizes
- Balancing visual appeal with code simplicity
- Implementing consistent hover effects across all interactive elements

## Technical Implementation
- All styling implemented using vanilla CSS (no external frameworks)
- Responsive design using media queries
- Interactive components styled with proper focus states
- Dark theme support through CSS variable overrides
